SWAT - System-Wide Analysis Toolkit

## QEMU GUI

SWAT includes GUI for managing QEMU virtual machines.

See more details in [qemu-gui documentation](https://github.com/ispras/qemu-gui/blob/master/docs/Using%20qemu-gui.md)

## WinDbg server

SWAT supports debugging with WinDbg without switching the guest OS to the
debug mode.

See more details in [documentation](docs/WinDbg.md)

## Reverse debugging

Reverse debugging allows "executing" the program in reverse direction.

See more details in [reverse debugging documentation](docs/ReverseDebugging.md)

## QEMU Plugins

SWAT includes QEMU which was extended to support instrumentation and introspection plugins.

See more details in [plugin documentation](docs/QemuPlugins.md)

## Virtual machine introspection

SWAT supports non-intrusive introspection of the virtual machine with the help of the dynamically loaded plugins.

Non-intrusiveness infers the following features:
* No need in loading any agents into the guest system
* Analysis and introspection can work when execution is replayed

See more details in [introspection documentation](docs/Introspection.md)
